            <p class="blogs">
              Meditation can wipe away the day's stress, bringing with it inner peace. See how you can easily learn 
              to practice meditation whenever you need it most. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. 
              Deep relaxation and mental calmness are two effects of meditation.You concentrate during meditation and get rid of the 
              constant stream of directionless ideas that could be stressing you out. The approach may lead to improved mental and emotional health.
              There are lots of benefit of it. It can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit both your emotional well-being and
              your overall health. You can also use it to relax and cope with stress by refocusing your attention on something calming. Meditation can
              help you learn to stay centered and keep inner peace. And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help
              carry you more calmly through your day. And meditation may help you manage symptoms of certain medical conditions. When you meditate, you 
              may clear away the information overload that builds up every day and contributes to your stress. The emotional and physical benefits of 
              meditation are - Gaining fresh insight into tough circumstances, Building skills to manage your stress, Focusing on the present, Reducing negative emotions,

              for your mind to wander during meditation, no matter how long you've been practicing meditation. If you're meditating to calm your mind and your 
              attention wanders, slowly return to the object, sensation or movement you're focusing on.

            <p class="blogs">
                "Consider the case where one of your friends shared a photo on Facebook.
                After like the photograph, you started reading the comments as well.
                Now, as you read through the comments, you see that even without refreshing the website, the number of
                likes has increased by 100 since you liked the picture. This magical count change is because of ReactJS.
                React is a declarative, effective, and adaptable JavaScript user interface library.
                ReactJS is an open-source front end library that is only in charge of the application's view layer.
                Facebook looks after it.

                The declarative approach used by React, which seeks to be both effective and versatile, makes it simpler
                to reason about your application. "</p>

            <h1 class="header">What magic JavaScript have:</h1>

            <p class="blogs">
                JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. JavaScript is very powerful language and
                easy to learn, JavaScript Can Change HTML Content, HTML Attribute Values, HTML Styles (CSS). We can use
                JavaScript code in between script tags.
                Scripts can be placed in the body or head according to our demand we can also be place script tag in
                external file.
                Now, what is JavaScript programs and statements? so like a computer program is a list of instructions to
                be executed by a computer same as a JavaScript program is a list of programming statements and
                JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.
                Next is JavaScript variables, it is used to store data values we can define it by var, const, and let. 
                An equal sign is used to assign values to variables then Javascript operator when we what to perform an
                arithmetical operations we use these operators ( +, -, *, % ). A set of values, variables, and operators 
                combined to create a value is called an 'expression' and the calculation is called 'evaluation'. Expressions can also contain variable values
                and the values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings. Now this is must to understand when you define some variable 
                JavaScript is case sensitive language like - the variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables. 
                LET or Let are not recognised as the keyword let by JavaScript. If we want to merge some words we are not allowed to use hyphen(-)
                they are reserved for substraction we can use underscore, uppercamel case (FirstName), lower camel case (firstName).

                “A man's favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice. He can't pull it out no matter how hard he tries.
                He therefore decides to bury it alive.

                Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it.
                More soil is poured.

                It shakes it off and steps up. The more the load was poured, the higher it rose. By noon, the donkey was
                grazing in green pastures.”</p>
