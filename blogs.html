            <p class="blogs">
                "Consider the case where one of your friends shared a photo on Facebook.
                After like the photograph, you started reading the comments as well.
                Now, as you read through the comments, you see that even without refreshing the website, the number of
                likes has increased by 100 since you liked the picture. This magical count change is because of ReactJS.
                React is a declarative, effective, and adaptable JavaScript user interface library.
                ReactJS is an open-source front end library that is only in charge of the application's view layer.
                Facebook looks after it.

                The declarative approach used by React, which seeks to be both effective and versatile, makes it simpler
                to reason about your application. "</p>

                be executed by a computer same as a JavaScript program is a list of programming statements and

                “A man's favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice. He can't pull it out no matter how hard he tries.
                He therefore decides to bury it alive.

                Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it.
                More soil is poured.

                It shakes it off and steps up. The more the load was poured, the higher it rose. By noon, the donkey was
                grazing in green pastures.”</p>
