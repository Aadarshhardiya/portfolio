                "Consider the case where one of your friends shared a photo on Facebook.
                After like the photograph, you started reading the comments as well.
                Now, as you read through the comments, you see that even without refreshing the website, the number of
                likes has increased by 100 since you liked the picture. This magical count change is because of ReactJS.
                React is a declarative, effective, and adaptable JavaScript user interface library.
                ReactJS is an open-source front end library that is only in charge of the application's view layer.
                Facebook looks after it.

                The declarative approach used by React, which seeks to be both effective and versatile, makes it simpler
                to reason about your application. "</p>

                "There was once a group of 100 people attending a seminar on personal development.

                In the middle of their talk, the speaker stops and decides to run an impromptu group activity. He hands
                out a balloon to each attendee and tells them to write their name on it.

                The balloons are then collected and placed in an adjacent room.

                The speaker then instructs the 100 attendees to enter that room and, within 5 short minutes, find the
                balloon with their name on it.

                Pandemonium breaks loose as they charge in, pushing and colliding with each other as they desperately
                search for their name.

                The 5 minutes pass and nobody succeeds.

                The speaker then tells each person to pick up any random balloon and give it the person whose name is
                written on it. Within a few minutes everyone has their balloon back.

                He then said, “What just happened with those balloons is exactly what happens in our search for
                happiness. We frantically look for it all around us, not knowing where it is.”

                Yet our happiness lies in the happiness of others. By giving them their happiness, you get yours.</p>

                “A man's favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice. He can't pull it out no matter how hard he tries. He therefore decides to bury it alive.

                Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it. More soil is poured.
            
                It shakes it off and steps up. The more the load was poured, the higher it rose. By noon, the donkey was grazing in green pastures.”</p>
